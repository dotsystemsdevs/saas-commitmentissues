## What it does

You paste a GitHub repo URL. We run it through our **death index scoring algorithm** and generate an official, downloadable death certificate : complete with cause of death, last words, and a score from 0 to 10.

```
https://github.com/facebook/react
              ↓
  Fetches repo metadata + latest commit
  via GitHub public API (no key needed)
              ↓
  Calculates death index (0–10)
              ↓
  ☠️ Certificate of Death
```

## Death Index

| Condition | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Last commit > 2 years ago | +4 |
| Last commit 1–2 years ago | +2 |
| Repo is `archived: true` | +3 |
| 20+ open issues AND inactive 6+ months | +1 |
| 100+ stars but no activity for 1+ year | +1 |

**Maximum: 10.** 0 = alive. 10 = fossil.

**Cause of death** is rule-based : the highest-scoring match wins:

| Condition | Cause of Death |
|-----------|---------------|
| `archived = true` | "Officially declared dead by author" |
| Last commit: "fix typo" or "update readme" | "Died whispering: one last fix" |
| Only 1–3 commits total | "Died after 3 commits and a burst of motivation" |
| 200+ stars but inactive | "Started strong. Never finished." |
| No description | "No README. No hope." |
| Default | "Side project syndrome" |
