## How it works

1. Paste a GitHub repository URL.
2. Fetch public repo metadata from the GitHub API.
3. Calculate a death score and cause-of-death.
4. Generate and export a Certificate of Death.

## Features

- A4-style death certificate with cause, last words, age, and stats
- Multi-format social exports (Instagram 4:5 / square, X, Facebook, Story)
- Native mobile Story/Reel-friendly share (9:16 on mobile)
- Hall of Shame leaderboard of famously abandoned repos
- Recently Buried live feed (latest public burials)

## Privacy

- No login required
- Only public GitHub data is used
- Recently Buried stores the latest public burial entries (repo, cause, score, timestamp)
- Anonymous aggregate analytics are used for product metrics

## Leaderboard data

The Hall of Shame list is currently curated for recognizable dead repos and fast first-load UX.
