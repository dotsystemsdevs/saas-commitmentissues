## What is Commitment Issues?

Paste a public GitHub repository URL and get a shareable **Certificate of Death**: a tongue-in-cheek summary of how “dead” the repo looks, with a score, cause of death, last words, and exportable graphics for social posts. No account required.

## Features

- **Certificate of Death** — A4-style layout with cause, last words, repo age, and derived stats
- **Exports** — Multiple aspect ratios (feed, square, story-style) for common social platforms
- **Mobile share** — Native share uses a tall story-friendly format on small screens to reduce bad crops
- **Hall of Shame** — Curated leaderboard of famously abandoned repositories
- **Recently Buried** — Live feed of the latest public burials (repo, cause, score, time)

## How scoring works (high level)

| Step | What happens |
|------|----------------|
| Input | You provide a public repo URL |
| Data | The app reads public metadata from the GitHub API |
| Score | A death score and narrative (cause, last words) are computed in `src/lib/scoring.ts` |
| Output | You get an on-screen certificate and optional image exports |

Hall of Shame entries are curated for recognizable repos and fast first paint; Recently Buried reflects real recent usage.

## Privacy

- No login required
- Only public GitHub data is used
- Recently Buried stores recent public burial entries (repo, cause, score, timestamp)
- Anonymous aggregate analytics may be used for product metrics

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dotsystemsdevs/commitmentissues.git
cd commitmentissues
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Environment

Optional: add a GitHub token to raise API rate limits.

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_yourtoken
```

Create a token under GitHub **Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens**. Fine-grained tokens work if you limit scope to what this app needs; classic tokens are also fine for local dev.

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

Scoring logic lives in `src/lib/scoring.ts` so it stays easy to test and change.

## Chrome extension (MVP)

A local MV3 extension is included under `extension/`.

### Load unpacked in Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the repository folder `extension/`

### Test flow

1. Open a GitHub repo root page such as `https://github.com/vercel/next.js`
2. Verify a tombstone badge appears near the repo header
3. Click the badge to open the full certificate on `commitmentissues.dev`
4. Navigate to another repo without full reload; verify no duplicate badge appears

If the API is rate-limited or unavailable, the badge falls back to `Reaper busy`.
