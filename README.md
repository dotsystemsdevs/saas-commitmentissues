Your abandoned repos deserve a proper funeral.

Paste a public GitHub URL. Get a shareable **Certificate of Death** — cause of death, last words, repo age, exportable graphics. No account required.

- **Mobile share** — Native share sheet on mobile with story-friendly format
- **Hall of Shame** — Curated leaderboard of famously abandoned repos
- **Recently Buried** — Live feed of the latest public burials
- **Chrome extension** — Tombstone badge injected on any GitHub repo page (MVP)

## Tech stack

| | |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) |
| Fonts | UnifrakturMaguntia, Courier Prime, Inter |
| Hosting | Vercel |
| Storage | Upstash Redis (counters + recent burials) |
| Data | GitHub public API |

## Getting started

Prerequisites: Node 18+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dotsystemsdevs/commitmentissues.git
cd commitmentissues
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Environment

Add a GitHub token to raise API rate limits (optional but recommended):

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_yourtoken
```

Generate one at **GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens**. Fine-grained or classic tokens both work.

> **Note:** The Recently Buried feed requires Upstash Redis (`KV_REST_API_URL` + `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`). Without it, the feed is hidden and the buried counter falls back to the historical baseline.

## How we pronounce repos dead

| Step | What happens |
|------|----------------|
| Input | You submit a public GitHub URL |
| Data | The app fetches public metadata via the GitHub API |
| Score | A death index and narrative are computed in `src/lib/scoring.ts` |
| Output | Certificate rendered on-screen, exportable as PNG |

Hall of Shame entries are hand-curated; Recently Buried reflects real usage.

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

extension/          ← Chrome extension (MV3, load unpacked)
```

## Chrome extension (MVP)

A MV3 extension lives under `extension/`. It injects a tombstone badge on GitHub repo pages and links to the full certificate.

### Load unpacked in Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `extension/` subfolder

### Test flow

1. Open a GitHub repo page (e.g. `https://github.com/vercel/next.js`)
2. Verify a tombstone badge appears near the repo header
3. Click the badge to open the full certificate on `commitmentissues.dev`
4. Navigate to another repo without a full reload; verify no duplicate badge appears

If the API is rate-limited or unavailable, the badge falls back to `Reaper busy`.
